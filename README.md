# Backpropagation_Through_Time


A Simple Design Pattern for TensorFlow Recurrency
===============

### Introduction
This repo includes the bptt.py library for recurrent graph bookkeeping (in Tensorflow) and a sample client which learns to predict a simple palindromic sequence using a double-layer LSTM (Graves 2013).
